         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Well but to paſſe all this, though much might be ſaid, you are now again at the ſtern of Government, and on the Throne; and I dare not but ſay, it is even of and by the Lord, and that it is he that hath done it, contrary to the expectations of many, and what his end is in it remaines with him; But I am ſure one cauſe is, that you may execute part of his wrath upon that <hi>treacherous generation of hipocritical and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men,</hi> ſome of the Army I mean) ſome of whom have bin deceitful to God, and treacherous to the Nation; and who have been <hi>feareful hipocrites by a ſhew of religion more then others:</hi> and have mocked God as it were, and his People; I need not ſay to you how that many of them were raiſed up from a low <hi>eſtate,</hi> and inſtead of ſerving the Nation, <hi>became their Lords and Oppreſſors,</hi> and they have <hi>abuſed</hi> the <hi>Lords Mercy to them,</hi> and exalted <hi>themſelves,</hi> and became as great <hi>oppreſſors,</hi> and as <hi>grievous</hi> to the Nation, as ever t ey were that went <hi>before them,</hi> and ſome of them took the very <hi>titles, and eſtates of their enemies:</hi> and followed their tyrannical ſpirit <hi>alſo,</hi> though the Lord was long ſuffering to them, and gave them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and put opportunities into their hands, wherein they might have done good, but they alſo neglected to ſerve God, and the Nation to ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and becauſe of the <hi>ambition &amp; pride of ſome of them,</hi> the Lord ſuffered them to make this laſt interruption upon you, which was great treachery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> you one whit more righteous then ſome of them, but you are as ſure to fall, as they are fallen, with no leſs meaſure of diſhonour and affliction then is come upon them, and you are in your laſt hour: And I dare not ſay that God expects much more from you, then for the end aforeſaid <hi>(viz.)</hi> to be the executioners of Juſtice upon men as ſinful as your ſelves, ſo do not glory over them that are fallen, but know that your time alſo is but ſhort, and your fall may prove to your deſtruction, and theirs may prove to make them better, and refine them: And if God hath choſen you to execute ſome part of his wrath upon them for their wickedneſs, he will doubtleſs find Inſtruments to execute his wrath upon you, elſe he will do it with his own hand, for he purpoſeth not to ſpare you, for your ſins cries as loud as the ſins of any other people, and the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are as great under you, as under them whom you condemn: And I deſire if there be any good men amongſt you, that ſuch who are wiſe may conſider, and mind the hand of the Lord in and through all theſe things that are come to paſs, for God is a working as well as you, he is ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſet up a Kingdome as well as you, and his Government and yours cannot ſtand together, and he will make you know that he is ſtronger, and his Government of more force, and your Kingdome cannot ſtand in place with his: Therefore oh that you would take heed! oh that you would be wiſe! if ſo be ſome of you may be ſpared, and be not too zealous in your way, nor too furious in your proceedings, do but to others, as you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to receive from others, and from the Lord; and go not beyond your Commiſſion, for a permiſſion you have (at leaſt) from God, even to ſcourge hypocrites, and to be a Judgment upon that hypocritical ſeeming religious generation of men aforeſaid, which have many times as it were mocked God, and pretended love to him with their lips, when their hearts have yearned after ſelf-honour, and treaſures of this world; I ſay your preſent hour and permiſſion is for this end, but not to perſecute the people of the Lord, nor to deſtroy Gods Heritage; but if you ſhall extend your power unto ſuch a work, and if you do perſecute the Innocent without cauſe, and make war againſt the Lamb and his followers, and make Laws and execute them to the oppreſſion of the Saints of the moſt High, then you go beyond your Commiſſion, for God hath not called you unto this, but to be inſtruments in another cauſe; and the Children of <hi>Zion,</hi> they truſt in the living God, and fears not the terror of mighty men, neither can they be afraid at the roaring of the Sea, nor at the preſent threatning of the Heathen, for God is with them.</p>
            <p>And I ſay to you, the ſervant of the Lord hath pondered and conſidered all theſe proceedings, and viewed the preſent ſtate of things at this day, and there is no Viſion from God unto you, of peace and comfort, nor of a happy and laſting Government, as you now ſtand; if any Prophet ſhall divine this unto you, he ſpeaks what he hath not from the Lord, but the viſion of his own heart, and he deceives you and himſelf, for you are not eſtabliſhed upon a right foundation, neither are you acted by a right ſpirit, which can truly govern for God; but the ſpirit of wrath and fury is put into you, for the work for which you are called: and I know not how to warn you, that you do not perſecute the people of God, for why? it may be you muſt fill up your meaſure of wickedneſs thereby, that God may break you perpetually, yet the leſs will be your judgement if you do it not, but and if you do it, the Lord will take occaſion againſt you, to wound you, and you ſhall never be healed; and as you do afflict others, ſo, and much more ſhall it be done unto you from the Lord: Wherefore conſider what I have ſaid, for this is the viſion of the Almighty unto you, that ſhall not go unfulfilled; and what you do, you muſt do it quickly, for your time is ſhort, and your power will God ſubdue, and his Power and Kingdome will he ſpeedily exalt over your heads, and make you and the whole Nations know, that he is God, and that all power is with him, and that he can do whatſoever he will, and it is his right alone to reign, and his childrens portion to poſſeſs the Kingdome with him: Let the whole earth, and all the powers thereof bow and tremble before him, let not your hearts be ſtout and rebellious againſt him, for he can grind you to powder, and ſink you into confuſion and miſery, as a ſtone into the Sea.</p>
